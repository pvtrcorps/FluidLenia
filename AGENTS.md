# Agents

Agents are the basic unit of life in the simulation. They are represented by a single pixel in the simulation grid.

## Agent Parameters

- Mass: The amount of mass the agent has. This is used to determine the agent's density.
- Structure: The agent's structure. This is used to determine the agent's color / adn.
- Energy: The agent's energy. This is used to determine the agent's behavior.

## Agent Behavior

Agents move based on the gradient of the potential field. The potential field is computed using a convolution of the agent's mass.

## Agent Growth

Agents grow based on the gradient of the growth function. The growth function is computed using the agent's mass and the potential field.

## Agent Death

Agents die based on the gradient of the decay function. The decay function is computed using the agent's mass and the potential field.

## Agent Reproduction

Agents reproduce based on the gradient of the reproduction function. The reproduction function is computed using the agent's mass and the potential field.

## Agent Mutation

Agents mutate based on the mutation rate. The mutation rate is a parameter that controls the amount of mutation that occurs.

## Agent Selection

Agents are selected based on their fitness. Fitness is determined by the agent's ability to survive and reproduce.

## Agent Evolution

Agents evolve based on natural selection. The fittest agents are more likely to survive and reproduce.

## Agent Interaction

Agents interact with each other based on their behavior. Interaction can be positive or negative, depending on the behavior of the agents.

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate with each other based on their behavior. Communication can be positive or negative, depending on the behavior of the agents.

## Agent Environment

Agents live in an environment that is determined by the simulation parameters. The environment can be modified by the user to create different scenarios.

## Agent Visualization

Agents are visualized using a color map. The color map is determined by the agent's structure and diet.
